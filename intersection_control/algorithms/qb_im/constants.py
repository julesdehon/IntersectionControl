    This is the message a vehicle sends when it does not have a reservation
    and wishes to make one. It contains the properties of the vehicle (ID number, performance, size, etc.) as well as 
    some properties of the proposed reservation (arrival time,
    arrival velocity, type of turn, arrival lane, etc.). The message also communicates the
    vehicle’s status as an emergency vehicle (in an emergency situation). In practice, this
    would be implemented using a secure method such that normal vehicles could not
    impersonate emergency vehicles. Such methods are well understood and the details
    of the implementation are beyond the scope of this research.
    
    This message has 15 fields:
    * vehicle_id               — a unique identifier for the vehicle.
    * arrival_time             — the absolute time at which the vehicle agrees to arrive at the intersection.
    * arrival_lane             — a unique identifier for the lane in which the vehicle will be when it
                                 arrives at the intersection.
    * arrival_velocity         — the velocity at which the vehicle agrees to be traveling when
                                 it arrives at the intersection.
    * vehicle_length           — the length of the vehicle.
    * vehicle_width            — the width of the vehicle.
    * maximum_acceleration     — the maximum rate at which the vehicle can accelerate
    * maximum_velocity         — the maximum velocity at which the vehicle can travel

    This is the message a vehicle sends when it has a reservation,

    could be extended in order to communicate statistics for each vehicle, which could
    then be recorded in order to analyze the performance of the intersection manager.

    """
    This message is a response to a vehicle’s Request (or Change-Request)
    message. It does not always mean that the parameters transmitted by the vehicle are
    acceptable. It could, for example, contain a counter-offer by the intersection. The
    reservation parameters in this message are implicitly accepted by the vehicle, and
    must be explicitly cancelled if the driver agent of the vehicle does not approve. Note
    that this is safe even with faulty communication—the worst that can happen is that
    the intersection reserves space that does not get used. Included in the message are
    acceleration constraints determined by the intersection. This is just a list of rates and
    durations. How the list is created depends on the intersection manager. However, the
    vehicle’s safety must be guaranteed if it adheres to the list.
    
    This message has 7 fields:
    * reservation_id   — a unique identifier for the reservation just created.
    * arrival_time     — the absolute time at which the vehicle is expected to arrive.
    * early_error      — the tolerable error (early) in arrival time for the vehicle.
    * late_error       — the tolerable error (late) in arrival time for the vehicle. Note that
                         the intersection manager must assume that the car could arrive and traverse the
                         intersection at any time within the resulting bounds
    * arrival_lane     — a unique identifier for the lane in which the vehicle should be when
                         it arrives at the intersection.
    * arrival_velocity — the velocity at which the vehicle is expected to be traveling
                         when it arrives at the intersection. A negative number signifies that any velocity
                         is acceptable.

    By sending this message, an intersection can inform a vehicle that the
    parameters sent in the latest Request (or Change-Request) were not acceptable,
    and that the intersection either could not or did not want to make a counter-offer.
    This message also indicates whether or not the rejection was because the reservation
    manager requires the vehicle to stop at the intersection before entering. This lets the
    driver agent know that it should not attempt any more reservations until it reaches
    the intersection.
