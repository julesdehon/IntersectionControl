    An intersection manager or vehicle can have a MessagingUnit, and use
    it to communicate with other vehicles or intersection managers. This class
    can be subclassed to provide different behaviours of varying complexity.
    For example, an implementation that uses a discrete event simulator
    such as Omnet++ or ns-3 to track node connectivity and provide complex
    routing behaviour.

    As a general rule, all MessagingUnits in an environment/experiment
    should be of the same type - although this API would allow for the
    implementation of different Unit types that behave slightly differently
    but are able to communicate.
